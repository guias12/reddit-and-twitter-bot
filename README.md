# reddit-and-twitter-bot
A Twitter bot that tweets images from a subreddit,
you can see(and follow :P) it working <a href="https://twitter.com/bot_blessimages/">here</a>
the code for the application that is running is on this <a href="https://github.com/guias12/py-twitter-reddit-bot">repo</a>
but it's just a refactor of the code that is here

# Installation:

If you wanna to use this, you'll only need to have node.js and php on your computer, then all you need to do is 
```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/guias12/reddit-and-twitter-bot.git
  
  $ cd ./reddit-and-twitter-bot
  
  $npm install
```
then you'll need to create and configure a `credentials/.env` file with your informations following [here](credentials/README.md).

# Usage: 

Once your project is properly installed, you may make some changes on the code(i hope you do). Then you can deploy to your server
to run the script you'll need to give the command
```bash
  $ php run.php  
```
and your bot will go online.
